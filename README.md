## CRUD Routes

The stock-chart module supports CRUD operations to the two main data sources it uses to support its operations:

| Data Source             | Sub-fields                                    | Base API                 |
|-----------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------:|
| Ticker Information      | Company name, Average price, owners, etc.     | /api/:stockId/info/CRUD  |
| Price Quotes            | Time-stamped price quotes across set intervals| /api/:stockId/quotes|

The CRUD operations supported for each data source are below:

### Ticker Information
